\section{Available Methods for Corner detection}


To find the points of interest we want to keep, I tried different corner detectors:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Tomasi-Kanade
    \item Rohr
    \item Foerstner-Harris
\end{itemize}


All of the above methods have in common that they make use of the \textit{structure tensor}
defined as
\[
    J_\rho(\nabla u) := K_\rho(\nabla u\nabla u^T) =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        K_\rho * (u_x^2)  & K_\rho * (u_xu_y) \\
        K_\rho * (u_xu_y) & K_\rho * (u_y^2)    \\
    \end{pmatrix}
\]
where $K_\rho$ is a gaussian convolution kernel with standard deviation $\rho$ and $u$ is a gaussian smoothed version of the original image $f$, i.e.
\[
    u = K_\sigma * f
\]

While being fairly accurate (insert examples here), the above methods don't really succeed in finding the most relevant corners. \\
That's the reason I chose an algorithm proposed by Luis Alvarez (reference here) that is based on the so called Affine Morphological Scale Space (or short \textbf{AMSS}).
He proposes a multiscale algorithm that tracks corners across the evolution of an image in this scale space.\\
The special property of this scale space is, that the shape of a corner evolves in such a way that the the actual tip of the corner moves linearly along the corner bisector. \\
Using this property, one can extract the exact location of a corner.


\subsection{AMSS corner detection}

\subsubsection{The affine morphological scale space}

The aforementioned AMSS is produced by the partial differential equation
\[
    u_t = t^\frac{1}{3}(u_{xx}u_y^2 + u_{yy}u_x^2 - 2u_xu_yu_{xy})^\frac{1}{3}
\]
